![Lucas](/assets/low quality.png)

My name is Lucas Beattie and I'm a structural engineer, primarily focused on bridges, in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati area. I work for [Palmer Engineering](https://www.palmernet.com/), designing and analyzing bridges. I really enjoy it when a slightly deeper dive into mechanics or math is needed to solve a problem, and I'm always looking for ways to use Excel VBA and SAP2000 in my work. [See my resume][resume] for further information.

Some of my interests outside of work include reading, fitness, learning spanish, personal finance, and travel. I've also had had some more eclectic past forays into juggling, guitar, and table tennis.

I expect content on this site to be at least half engineering, excel, or programming related, and otherwise plan to write about my other interests, experiments, or activities. But I make no promises!
